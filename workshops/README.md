# Hands-on Gen AI Workshops

We have designed a series of hands-on workshops to take you from zero to hero with Generative AI. Here's a list of workshops we currently have:

|Workshop name | Links | Description | Language | Tools used |
|------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| Vector Search: Beginner to Pro | [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vR4lPTcr2ZXPTkQLPq3HtTn4vSLG4VrFD3jkOjXmEDrrvyLEElTaz-6JC5KZN4__VJZ2h13aTabGXhG/pub), [Hands-on Lab](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/vector-search-lab/) | Learn vector search concepts such as embeddings, how vector search works in MongoDB, and also advanced concepts such as pre-filtering, vector quantization etc. Gain hands-on experience by building a multimodal vector search application for an online library. | Python | MongoDB Atlas, Voyage AI|
