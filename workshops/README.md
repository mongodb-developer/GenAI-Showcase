# Hands-on Gen AI Workshops

We have designed a series of hands-on workshops to take you from zero to hero with Generative AI. Here's a list of workshops we currently have:

|Workshop name | Link | Description | Language | Tools used |
|------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| Vector Search: Beginner to Pro | [Start Lab](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/vector-search-lab/) | Learn vector search concepts such as embeddings, how vector search works in MongoDB, and also advanced concepts such as pre-filtering, vector quantization etc. Gain hands-on experience by building a multimodal vector search application for an online library. | Python | MongoDB Atlas, HuggingFace, OpenAI (CLIP)|
| Building RAG Applications with MongoDB | [Start Lab](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/ai-rag-lab/) | Learn RAG concepts such as embedding, chunking and vector search. Gain hands-on experience by building a RAG-based chatbot for a technical documentation website. | Python | MongoDB Atlas, HuggingFace, Anthropic/Azure OpenAI/Gemini |
| The A to Z of Building AI Agents | [Start Lab](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/ai-agents-lab/) | Learn the core concepts of AI agents, such as reasoning, tools, and memory. Gain hands-on experience by buiding a technical documentation AI agent. | Python | MongoDB Atlas, HuggingFace, Anthropic/Azure OpenAI/Gemini, LangGraph |
| Pragmatic LLM Application Development: From RAG Pipelines to AI Agents | [Start Lab](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/GenAI-Showcase/blob/main/notebooks/workshops/Pragmatic_LLM_Application_Introduction_From_RAG_to_Agents_with_MongoDB.ipynb) | Build RAG pipelines and AI agents with and without abstraction frameworks such as LangChain. Also introduces techniques such as prompt compression for optimizing LLM apps. | Python | MongoDB Atlas, OpenAI, LangChain, LLMLingua |
