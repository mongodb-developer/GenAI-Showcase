        "    \"What are MongoDB indexes? Indexes are special data structures that store a small portion of your data in an easy-to-traverse form. Like a book's index helps you find topics without reading every page, MongoDB indexes help find documents without scanning the entire collection.\",\n",
        "    \"How indexes improve query performance: Without an index, MongoDB must scan every document in a collection (a collection scan) to find matches. With an index, MongoDB can limit the number of documents it must inspect. For a collection with millions of documents, this means the difference between a query taking seconds versus milliseconds.\",\n",
        "    \"Understanding index types: MongoDB supports several index types. Single field indexes are the simplest, indexing one field. Compound indexes index multiple fields together and are useful when queries filter on multiple fields. Text indexes enable text search capabilities, while geospatial indexes support location-based queries.\",\n",
        "    \"The tradeoffs of indexing: While indexes speed up read operations, they slow down writes because MongoDB must update indexes whenever documents change. Indexes also consume disk space and memory. It's important to create indexes strategically for your most common queries rather than indexing every field.\",\n",

        "    \"Building compound indexes: ```javascript\\ndb.orders.createIndex({ user_id: 1, created_at: -1 })\\n// This supports queries on user_id alone, or user_id + created_at\\n// But NOT queries on created_at alone``` Field order matters - most selective field should come first.\",\n",
        "    \"Creating unique indexes: ```javascript\\ndb.users.createIndex({ email: 1 }, { unique: true })\\n// Prevents duplicate email addresses\\ndb.sessions.createIndex({ token: 1 }, { unique: true, sparse: true })``` Sparse indexes only include documents with the indexed field.\",\n",
        "    \"Adding indexes with options: ```javascript\\ndb.logs.createIndex(\\n  { created_at: 1 },\\n  { expireAfterSeconds: 86400 } // TTL index, auto-deletes after 24 hours\\n)\\ndb.large_collection.createIndex({ status: 1 }, { background: true })``` Background builds don't block database operations.\",\n",
