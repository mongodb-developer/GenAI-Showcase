There was dirt literally everywhere and it looked like the common areas, bathroom, and room hadn\\\\u2019t been swept in ages. The bathroom had grime and hair on the sink, floor and in the bathtub. The room was supposed to be two queen beds but instead was one twin and one queen and was super cramped and uncomfortable. The room was also supposed to have a \\\\u201cview\\\\u201d according to the listing but all we saw were the neighbors\\\\u2019 backyard as well as a huge pile of random trash. The soap dispenser in the bathroom had soap so diluted with water that we ended up using hand sanitizer to clean our hands. The listing also said it was close to downtown but it ended up being a 45-1 hour trip to downtown one way (bus and then train), and it was super inaccessible. Overall I\\\\u2019m really disappointed because the listing looked lovely and instead it ended up being super gross and really uncomfortable for all of us. Additionally there were a ton of people there and the lock on the door for our room was super broken down and could easily have been opened. I\\\\u2019m also pretty sure that mould/dust in the house is the reason my friend got sick the first night we were there.  \\\\n\\\\nI have stayed in cheaper places that have been nicer than this and it was so awful to have this trip ruined for us. Our friend group was meeting for the first time in over 8 months and it was such a let down as the host seemed really nice and down to earth. We definitely learned our lesson to do more research and to plan further in advance to book a better place for New Years in the future.\"}]', 'weekly_price': None, 'monthly_price': None,

There was dirt literally everywhere and it looked like the common areas, bathroom, and room hadn\\\\u2019t been swept in ages. The bathroom had grime and hair on the sink, floor and in the bathtub. The room was supposed to be two queen beds but instead was one twin and one queen and was super cramped and uncomfortable. The room was also supposed to have a \\\\u201cview\\\\u201d according to the listing but all we saw were the neighbors\\\\u2019 backyard as well as a huge pile of random trash. The soap dispenser in the bathroom had soap so diluted with water that we ended up using hand sanitizer to clean our hands. The listing also said it was close to downtown but it ended up being a 45-1 hour trip to downtown one way (bus and then train), and it was super inaccessible. Overall I\\\\u2019m really disappointed because the listing looked lovely and instead it ended up being super gross and really uncomfortable for all of us. Additionally there were a ton of people there and the lock on the door for our room was super broken down and could easily have been opened. I\\\\u2019m also pretty sure that mould/dust in the house is the reason my friend got sick the first night we were there.  \\\\n\\\\nI have stayed in cheaper places that have been nicer than this and it was so awful to have this trip ruined for us. Our friend group was meeting for the first time in over 8 months and it was such a let down as the host seemed really nice and down to earth. We definitely learned our lesson to do more research and to plan further in advance to book a better place for New Years in the future.\"}]', 'weekly_price': None, 'monthly_price': None,

It is mentioned under house rules that it is a  shared bathroom. I wish this was written upfront on the summary page.

The bathroom was also not in a great shape, there was a hole where the toilet paper role was but it got fixed the very next day, which was great. The unfortunate part is that we didn\\'t realize it was a shared bathroom with other guests which was quite annoying as we are quite picky people . It is mentioned under house rules that it is a  shared bathroom. I wish this was written upfront on the summary page. Also whenever we wanted to go back to the house we had to call the host as we did not have the keys. The host was very accommodating but we felt bad going late.

We got the impression that other residents/the landlord did not want non-residential guests staying in the building - this made us feel uncomfortable several times throughout our stay.\"}]',
