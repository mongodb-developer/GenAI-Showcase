    "# Using Smolagents with MongoDB Atlas\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use [Smolagents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents) to interact with MongoDB Atlas for building AI-powered applications. We'll explore how to create tools that leverage MongoDB's aggregation capabilities to analyze and extract insights from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook, you'll need:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A MongoDB Atlas account and cluster\n",
    "2. Python environment with required packages\n",
    "3. OpenAI API key for GPT-4 access\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting Up MongoDB Atlas\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a free MongoDB Atlas account at [https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register)\n",
    "2. Create a new cluster (free tier is sufficient)\n",
    "3. Configure network access by adding your IP address\n",
    "4. Create a database user with read/write permissions\n",
    "5. Get your connection string from Atlas UI (Click \"Connect\" > \"Connect your application\")\n",
    "6. Replace `<password>` in the connection string with your database user's password\n",
    "7. Enable network access from your IP address in the Network Access settings\n",
    "\n",
    "## Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we:\n",
    "- Define tools that interact with MongoDB Atlas using pymongo\n",
    "- Use aggregation pipelines to analyze data\n",
    "- Sample documents to understand schema structure\n",
    "- Demonstrate how LLMs can generate and execute MongoDB queries\n",
    "\n",
    "The tools showcase how to:\n",
    "1. Execute aggregation pipelines generated by the LLM\n",
    "2. Sample documents to understand collection structure\n",
    "3. Handle errors and provide meaningful feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with MongoDB Atlas:\n",
    "- Never commit connection strings with credentials to version control\n",
    "- Use environment variables or secure secret management\n",
    "- Restrict database user permissions to only what's needed\n",
    "- Enable IP allowlist in Atlas Network Access settings"

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook successfully demonstrates the integration of Smolagents with MongoDB Atlas, enabling effective data analysis through an AI agent.  The defined tools, `get_aggregated_docs` and `sample_documents`, effectively interact with the Airbnb dataset stored in MongoDB Atlas.  The agent, powered by a chosen LLM (in this case, GPT-4o), successfully translates user queries into both data sampling and aggregation pipelines executed against the MongoDB database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key improvements and observations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Robust Tool Design:** The tools now incorporate error handling, providing more informative feedback to the user in case of issues.  The exclusion of embedding fields from queries enhances performance and readability of results.\n",
    "* **Enhanced Query Handling:**  The inclusion of an initial projection stage in the aggregation pipeline, specifically designed to remove embedding fields (`text_embeddings` and `image_embeddings`) prior to other stages, ensures more efficient query execution and smaller response sizes.  The use of `json.loads()` ensures that the pipeline string received from the LLM is correctly parsed.\n",
    "Atlas Search excels at finding relevant documents quickly, thanks to its vector search capabilities.  This is particularly beneficial for large datasets where traditional keyword search may be insufficient.\n",
    "* **Improved User Experience:** Clearer tool documentation and example usage further enhance the user's ability to interact with the agent and interpret results.\n",
    "* **Practical Application:** The demonstration showcases a practical application for analyzing data within a MongoDB Atlas database using an LLM-powered agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future development could explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Expanded Toolset:** Implementing additional tools for data manipulation, filtering, and more complex analytics.\n",
    "* **Advanced Query Generation:** Exploring methods to refine the LLM's ability to generate accurate and efficient MongoDB queries.\n",
    "* **Visualization Capabilities:** Integrating data visualization libraries to present the analysis results more effectively.\n",
    "* **Security Enhancements:** Further solidifying security practices, potentially incorporating environment variable management for sensitive credentials."
