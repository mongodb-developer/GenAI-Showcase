    "**Use Case:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook demonstrates how to optimize vector database performance, specifically focusing on reducing retrieval latency using quantization methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario**:\n",
    "You have a large dataset of text data (in this case, a book from Gutenberg) and you want to build a system that can efficiently find similar pieces of text based on a user's query.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach**:\n",
    "- Embeddings: The notebook uses SentenceTransformer to convert text into numerical vectors (embeddings) which capture the semantic meaning of the text.\n",
    "- Vector Database: MongoDB is used as a vector database to store and search these embeddings efficiently.\n",
    "- Quantization: To speed up retrieval, the notebook applies quantization techniques (scalar and binary) to the embeddings. This reduces the size of the embeddings, making searches faster but potentially impacting precision.\n",
    "Goal: By comparing the performance of different embedding types (float32, int8, binary), the notebook aims to show the trade-offs between retrieval speed and accuracy when using quantization. This helps in choosing the best approach for a given use case."

    "Quantization is a powerful tool for optimizing vector database performance, especially in applications that handle high-dimensional embeddings like semantic search and recommendation systems. This tutorial demonstrated the implementation of scalar and binary quantization methods using Nomic embeddings with MongoDB as the vector database. \n",

    "Cost Reduction and Resource Efficiency: Efficient data storage and retrieval reduce the need for excessive computational resources, leading to cost savings.\n",
    "By examining the trade-offs between retrieval accuracy and performance across different embedding formats (float32, int8, and binary), we showcased how MongoDB's capabilities, such as vector indexing and automatic quantization, can streamline data storage, retrieval, and analysis. \n",

    "From this tutorial, we’ve explored Atlas Vector Search native capabilities for scalar quantization as well as binary quantization with rescoring. Our implementation showed that automatic quantization increases scalability and cost savings by reducing the storage and computational resources for efficient processing of vectors. In most cases, automatic quantization reduces the RAM for mongot by 3.75x for scalar and by 24x for binary; the vector values shrink by 4x and 32x, respectively, but the Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds graph itself does not shrink.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend automatic quantization if you have a large number of full-fidelity vectors, typically over 10M vectors. After quantization, you index reduced representation vectors without compromising the accuracy of your retrieval.\n",
    "To further explore quantization techniques and their applications, refer to resources like [Ingesting Quantized Vectors with Cohere](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/atlas/ingesting_quantized_vectors_with_cohere/). An [additional notebook](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/GenAI-Showcase/blob/main/notebooks/techniques/advanced_evaluation_of_quantized_vectors_using_cohere_mongodb_beir.ipynb) for comparing retrieval accuracy between quantized and non-quantized vectors is also available to deepen your understanding of these methods."
