    "# Vector Database Comparison For AI Workloads: Elasticsearch vs MongoDB Atlas Vector Search\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mongodb-developer/GenAI-Showcase/blob/main/notebooks/performance_guidance/vector_database_comparison_mongodb_elastic.ipynb)\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "While both MongoDB Atlas and Elasticsearch can store vector embeddings for AI applications, they serve fundamentally different purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Elasticsearch** is primarily a search engine optimized for information retrieval and analytics. While it can store vector embeddings, it wasn't designed as a primary database for applications that require strong consistency and ACID properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MongoDB Atlas** is a fully-featured database with built-in vector search capabilities. As a true database, MongoDB provides ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), which is essential for production AI applications that require data reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why ACID Compliance Matters for AI Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Atomicity**: Ensures that complex AI operations (like updating a knowledge base with new embeddings) either complete entirely or not at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Consistency**: Guarantees that AI systems work with consistent data, preventing issues like training on inconsistent datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Isolation**: Allows multiple AI processes to work concurrently without interfering with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Durability**: Ensures that committed AI data (like trained embeddings or inference results) isn't lost due to system failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll compare both systems for AI workloads, but keep in mind that while Elasticsearch excels at search-specific tasks, MongoDB provides a complete solution for AI applications that need both vector search and database functionality.\n",

    "#### Note: In the MongoDB hybrid search function, two weights:\n",
    "    - `vector_weight` \n",
    "    - `full_text_weight` \n",
    "\n",
    "They are used to control the influence of each search component on the final score. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how they work:\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose:\n",
    "The weights allow you to adjust how much the vector (semantic) search and the full-text search contribute to the overall ranking. \n",
    "For example, a higher full_text_weight means that the full-text search results will have a larger impact on the final score, whereas a higher vector_weight would give more importance to the vector similarity score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage in the Pipeline:\n",
    "Within the aggregation pipeline, after retrieving results from each search type, the function computes a reciprocal ranking score for each result (using an expression like `1/(rank + 60)`). \n",
    "This score is then multiplied by the corresponding weight:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vector Search:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"vs_score\": {\n",
    "  \"$multiply\": [ vector_weight, { \"$divide\": [1.0, { \"$add\": [\"$rank\", 60] } ] } ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Full-Text Search:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"fts_score\": {\n",
    "  \"$multiply\": [ full_text_weight, { \"$divide\": [1.0, { \"$add\": [\"$rank\", 60] } ] } ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, these weighted scores are combined (typically by adding them together) to produce a final score that determines the ranking of the documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact:**\n",
    "By adjusting these weights, you can fine-tune the search results to better match your application's needs. For instance, if the full-text component is more reliable for your dataset, you might set full_text_weight higher than vector_weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights in the MongoDB function allow you to balance the contributions from vector-based and full-text search components, ensuring that the final ranking score reflects the desired importance of each search method."
